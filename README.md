# Glitch's Ledger code for AresMUSH

**NO SUPPORT PROVIDED GOOD LUCK :)**

This system was created by Glitch and used extensively on City of Glass to manage locked notes. Ledger is fully customizable and flexible, so people can freely use the config files for it as just a reference for other stuff they want to do with it.

This should be considered abandonware: nothing in it is going to change or be updated, and the documentation included is all you get.


## Install

1. `plugin/install <github url>`
2. Update the custom code hooks using the examples in the `custom/` folder.
3. You may need to restart the game.


## Uninstall

You will need to remove all the ledger database objects from the database, then remove the plugin itself. See [removing plugins](https://aresmush.com/tutorials/code/contribs.html#uninstalling-plugins) for help.
